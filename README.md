# Geometric-Algorithms
C++ implementation for all sorts of geometric algorithms. I use OpenCV for point types and displaying results. 

## Implemented Algorithms
- Graham's scan
- Right tangent between a convex polygon and a query point
- Maximal dot product (support) between a convex polygon and a query point
- Check if some polygon is a CCW convex hull
- Orientation test
- Line intersection test
- Constructing a polygon from n points
- Generating a random polygon 
- Visualizing polygons and query points

## To Do
- Arrange as static library and app
- Add tests
- Clean the code
- Add documentation
- Chan's algorithm
